# Data-Visualisation-Practice

### My Process
- Having never used D3 or VX I started off by reading the VX docs. With no experience in D3 they didn't make too much sense to me straight away, so I found a tutorial to follow to put it into context (https://codedaily.io/tutorials/39/Make-a-Beautiful-Interactive-Bitcoin-Price-Chart-with-React-D3-and-VX).
- I decided to only use code that I understood and could adjust to my needs. Therefore after looking at stacked bar graphs I settled on sticking with a linegraph which had been covered in the tutorial, and decided to show authors posting frequency over time. 
- I have never used Apollo before so went to the website to learn how to use on the front end (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/).
- To save time I used create-react-app. 
- I used Playground to formulate my query.

### Challenges I faced
- The major challenge was my complete lack of experience. This meant that I had to write off more interesting graphs and user interaction features (e.g. tooltip) as I did not think I could understand them and write the necessary code within 6 hours.
- I also found the VX documentation relied on base knowledge of using D3, so I had to search outside of the documentation to better understand how everything tied together.
